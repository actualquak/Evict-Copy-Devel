/**
 * Phase 1 of the Evict round system.
 *
 * Implemented:
 * - every generated neutral core belongs to Fallen team #18
 * - a first-time player receives a random unique team ID from #1..#128,
 *   excluding #18
 * - a safe unclaimed start hex is selected with two complete hexes between
 *   player starts
 * - edge / filled-wall protection is preferred
 * - reconnecting during the same round returns to the same team
 * - if no safe start hex exists, the player remains playable in Fallen team
 *
 * Implemented in the current phase:
 * - exact one-time starting resources on personal-core claim
 * - the Evict start schematic, anchored to the centered Nucleus
 *
 * Implemented in the current phase:
 * - destroyed registered cores leave an empty hex center for five seconds
 * - every synthetic building in the captured hex is removed
 * - the attacker receives a centered 3x3 Core Shard without bonus items
 * - existing attacker resources remain untouched because Mindustry cores
 *   intentionally share one team inventory
 * - personal-team elimination messages
 * - victory detection after all capture delays have finished
 * - Fallen can win only after at least one personal start core was assigned
 * - one guarded automatic random-seed round reset
